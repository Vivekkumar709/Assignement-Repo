Section 1: Git & GitHub

1. Difference between Git and GitHub
Git is a distributed version control system used to track code changes locally. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features like pull requests, issues, code reviews, and CI/CD integration for team development.

2. git clone, git pull, git fetch
git clone creates a local copy of a remote repository. git pull fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch. git fetch only downloads updates without merging, allowing review before integration.

3. Merge conflict and resolution
A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically combine changes from different branches. It is resolved by manually editing conflicting files, choosing correct code, removing conflict markers, testing changes, and committing the resolved version.

4. git merge vs git rebase
git merge combines branches and preserves commit history with a merge commit. git rebase rewrites commit history by applying commits sequentially on another branch, creating a cleaner but altered history, mainly used for maintaining linear commits.

5. .gitignore importance
.gitignore specifies files and directories Git should not track, such as node_modules, environment files, and logs. It keeps repositories clean, reduces unnecessary commits, improves security, and avoids sharing machine-specific or sensitive files.

Section 2: MySQL & PostgreSQL

1. MySQL vs PostgreSQL
MySQL is faster for simple read-heavy applications and widely used in web projects. PostgreSQL is more advanced, supports complex queries, JSON, custom types, and follows SQL standards strictly, making it suitable for enterprise and analytical applications.

2. Primary key and foreign key
A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot be null. A foreign key references a primary key from another table, maintaining referential integrity and establishing relationships between tables.

3. WHERE vs HAVING
WHERE filters rows before grouping and cannot use aggregate functions. HAVING filters grouped results after aggregation and works with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG.

4. DELETE vs TRUNCATE
DELETE removes selected rows and can be rolled back; it triggers hooks and respects conditions. TRUNCATE removes all rows instantly, resets identity counters, is faster, and cannot be rolled back.

5. Database normalization
Database normalization is the process of organizing data into tables to reduce redundancy and dependency. It improves data integrity, minimizes anomalies, and ensures efficient storage by following normal forms like 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

6. INNER, LEFT, RIGHT JOIN
INNER JOIN returns matching records from both tables. LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right. RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left.

7. SQL queries
INSERT adds new records, SELECT retrieves data, UPDATE modifies existing records, DELETE removes records, and JOIN combines data from multiple tables using related columns such as primary and foreign keys.

Section 3: React Fundamentals

1. What is React and why used
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components. It uses a virtual DOM for efficient updates, improves performance, supports one-way data flow, and is widely used for scalable single-page applications.

2. State vs Props
State is mutable data managed inside a component and can change over time. Props are immutable inputs passed from parent to child components to share data and configure behavior.

3. React hooks
React hooks are functions like useState, useEffect, and useContext that allow functional components to manage state, side effects, and lifecycle features without using class components.

4. useEffect explanation
useEffect handles side effects such as API calls, subscriptions, and DOM updates. It runs after render and can depend on variables. Dependency arrays control when the effect executes or cleans up.

5. Lifting state up
Lifting state up means moving shared state to the closest common parent component so multiple child components can access and modify the same data, ensuring consistency and better state management.

Section 4: TypeScript Basics

1. What is TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, interfaces, and compile-time error checking. It improves code quality, scalability, and maintainability, especially in large applications.

2. any vs unknown
any disables type checking and allows any operation. unknown is safer and requires type checking before usage, preventing runtime errors while still supporting dynamic values.

3. Interfaces in TypeScript
Interfaces define the structure of objects by specifying properties and methods. They improve code readability, enforce contracts, and help catch errors during development.

4. Type inference
Type inference allows TypeScript to automatically determine variable types based on assigned values, reducing the need for explicit type annotations while maintaining strong type safety.

5. Optional and readonly properties
Optional properties use ? and may or may not exist. Readonly properties cannot be modified after initialization, ensuring immutability and preventing accidental changes.

Section 5: General Web Development

1. REST API
A REST API follows architectural principles using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It enables communication between client and server using stateless requests and structured endpoints.

2. PUT vs PATCH
PUT replaces the entire resource with new data, while PATCH updates only specific fields. PATCH is more efficient for partial updates.

3. CORS
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how resources are shared across different origins. It prevents unauthorized cross-domain requests using HTTP headers.

4. SQL vs NoSQL
SQL databases use structured schemas and relational tables. NoSQL databases are schema-less, scalable, and handle unstructured data, making them suitable for big data and real-time applications.

5. MVC architecture
MVC separates an application into Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic). This separation improves maintainability, scalability, and organized development.
